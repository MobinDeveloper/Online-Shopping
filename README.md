This is a Spring and Hibernate based Online Shopping and Ordering Web Service. 
Main works include but not limit to:
- Used Spring MVC to support item search and listing (dependency injection, inversion of control, REST API, etc.).
- Implemented security workflow via in-memory and JDBC authentication provided by Spring Security. 
- Utilized Hibernate to provide better support of database operations.
- Developed a Spring Web Flow to support item ordering.
